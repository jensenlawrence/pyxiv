    "With the import complete, we now create the relevant instance of the `Search` class. Based on the kind of search we want to perform, our search must specify `query`, `start_date`, and `end_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, to determine the correct form of the `Search` class's `query` argument, we need to understand how the arXiv API [formats queries](https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html). However, the procedure is straightforward in this case. First, since we are interested in papers involving both exoplanets and machine learning, we need to specify `\"all:exoplanets AND all:machine learning\"` in the query. Using the `\"all\"` tag simply informs the API to search for papers that contain the keywords `\"exoplanets\"` and `\"machine learning\"` in any of their fields, while using `\"AND\"` to join the two keywords informs that API to search for papers involving both exoplanets and machine learning. Next, since we only want to consider papers submitted to the category astro-ph.EP, we add `\"AND cat:astro-ph.EP\"` to the query. Thus, our query is `\"all:exoplanets AND all:machine learning AND cat:astro-ph.EP\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this query to the arXiv API documentation (linked previously), we may notice that this query contains spaces, while example queries in the documentation use + instead. This query still works, though, because the `Search` class automatically replaces all spaces with pluses behind the scenes. Therefore, the queries `\"all:exoplanets AND all:machine learning AND cat:astro-ph.EP\"` and `\"all:exoplanets+AND+all:machine+learning+AND+cat:astro-ph.EP\"` are identical to `Search` (but not to the arXiv API alone!), with the former being preferred for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify `start_date` and `end_date`, all we need to do is convert the desired dates to ISO-formatted date strings (i.e. strings of the form `\"YYYY-MM-DD\"`). This gives us `start_date = \"2023-03-14\"` and `end_date = \"2023-05-04\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting everything together, we get the following instance of `Search`."
